 # FAQ Accordion Card Challenge Solution

This repository contains my solution to the FAQ Accordion Card Challenge from Frontend Mentors. The challenge involved building a responsive and interactive FAQ section using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Challenge Description

The FAQ Accordion Card Challenge is a Frontend Mentors challenge that tests and improves frontend development skills. The goal of this challenge is to create a responsive and interactive FAQ section where users can click on the question to reveal the answer.

The challenge provides a design file in PNG format and a starter code file with the basic structure of the HTML markup. The task is to complete the implementation by adding CSS styles and JavaScript functionality to create an accordion-like behavior.

## Solution Overview

In my solution, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive FAQ accordion card. Here's an overview of the main components and features of my implementation:

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure consists of a series of question-answer pairs contained within a parent container. Each pair is represented by an `<div>` element that contains a `<button>` for the question and a `<div>` for the answer.

### CSS Styling

I applied CSS styles to create the desired layout and appearance of the FAQ accordion card. This includes styling the question and answer elements, setting up transitions and animations, and handling responsiveness for different screen sizes.

### JavaScript Functionality

To enable the interactivity of the FAQ accordion, I implemented JavaScript code. This code handles click events on the question buttons and toggles the visibility of the corresponding answer sections. Additionally, it ensures that only one answer is visible at a time, collapsing any previously expanded answers.

## Usage

To use or explore this solution, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone <repository-url>

2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

4. You should now see the FAQ Accordion Card rendered in the browser.

5. Click on the question buttons to expand and collapse the corresponding answers.

## Resources

In building this solution, I relied on the following resources:

- Frontend Mentors: This challenge was provided by Frontend Mentors, and the starter code and design files were obtained from their website.

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Documentation: I referred to official documentation and resources for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement various features and concepts.
